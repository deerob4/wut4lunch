Wut 4 Lunch
===========
Wut 4 Lunch is a basic social network designed for sharing lunches. It really isn't finished yet, but building it is simple enough:

* Clone the repository into a directory
* Install the required packages into a virtualenv (pip install -r requirements.txt)
* Run manage.py and pass the runserver argument

The different parts of the program can be found in the following files:
* Database models - models.py
* Form declarations and validation - forms.py
* Application initialisation - _init_.py
* Template files - templates/*.html
* Main application logic (routing, etc...) - controllers/main.py

Every other file is pretty self explanatory.
